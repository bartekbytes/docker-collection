# docker-collection

This is a repo with various **Docker / Docker Compose** yaml files for various purposes.

I created this repo mainly for my private usage, in order to keep all different Docker / Docker Compose set up in one place, but of course, **feel free to use it** :)

And please let me know when you'll find any bugs or you'll have any proposals to improve them.

Folder structure (each of the folder has a **README.md** file with more details):

- **postgresql** -> folder where all PostgreSQL-related yaml files are stored
- **spark** -> folder where all Spark-related yaml files are strored
